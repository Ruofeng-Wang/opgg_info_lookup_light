Have you been bothered by the long loading time of op.gg?
For me, all I need is counter and strong against champions information in most of my games. This project is just a simple python program that gives you plain text information about counter and strong against champions.
How to use:
	In terminal:
		run python opgglookup.py
		then type the champion name and line info(e.g., irelia top)
